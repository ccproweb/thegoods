# This repository is for monthly content related to MEAN and stack III algorithms

## Overview

#### Week 1

In week 1 we will learn about different sorts. In addition to implementing a variety of sorts, we will also discuss Big-O notation and its relevance in analyzing algorithm performance. Week 1 will also serve as our first opportunity to dig into actually measuring and verifying performance using built in node tools like the process api

#### Week 2

Week 2 will see us move into a discussion of abstract data structures and a tangible exercise demonstrating the difference between an interface and implementation. We will introduce ourselves to a testing framework - jest - to work with and validate our work. We will start with sets and using jest to validate behavior. From there we will look at the abstract data structure called a Priority Queue and implement our own solution to meet its needs. Finally, we will look Heaps as an implementation of a PQ and tool for some miscellaneous tasks including another sort!

#### Week 3

Week 3 will combinie all of the non-code ideas we've been wrestling with this month - performance, interface v implementation, design, and testing. We will use all of these things to explore how HashTables work and explore their myriad of uses. In the process we will develop our own HashTable class and look a data structure called a Retrieval Tree that can serve as a HashTable, but also has its own set of operations that can be useful to us. We will end the week getting a tree class ready for next week :D

#### Week 4

Week 4 we will return to Trees land for Monday and Tuesday, exploring some traversals and their various applications. Wenesday will be the algorithm exam for the stack. It'll be straightforward and on a machine. Thursday and Friday will serve as a quick intro to graphs and their concepts to help prime any individual research into the data structure and its uses.

## Thoughts
This week we are going to go ahead and look at a group of data structures that will allow us to explore performance and how abstract data structures can be used. First, we are going to be looking at sets and priority queues, two generalized data structures that have common expected behaviors but can implemented a variety of ways. Working with sets will also give us a good opportunity to stretch our algorithm muscles and explore some generic concepts we can add to our problem solving toolkit. Priority Queues will give us an opportunity to flex our problem solving muscles as it regards to designing around performance. We'll close out the week looking at a data structure that can be used as a priority queue, but because of its implementation can be used efficiently for other things as well.

Please use the string name of the appropriate time complexity according to the tabel below.
| Notation  | "name"    |
-------------------------
| O(1)      | "constant |
| O(n)      | "linear"  |
| O(n^2)    |"quadratic"|
| O(n^3)    |  "cubic"  |
| O(log n)  |"logarithmic"|
|O(n * log n)|"quasilinear"|

### 5 Algorithms
Given an amount of currency called _amt_, and a dictionary representing the various coin names & values called _legend_, write a function that calculates the most efficient change for the given _amt_. You may assume that _legend_ will include coins with unique values & a coin with a value of 1.
